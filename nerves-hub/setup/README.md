## Getting Started

The following sections will walk you through updating your Nerves project to work with the [nerves-hub.org](https://nerves-hub.org) NervesHub server. Using your own NervesHub server will require setting URLs to point elsewhere and is not covered below to simplify first usage.

Many of the following steps may feel manual, but they can and are automated by NervesHub users to set up automatic firmware updates from CI and to manufacture large numbers of devices.
