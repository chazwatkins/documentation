# Introduction

**NOTE: I'm caught up with work and not able to get to the docs right now. The NervesKey GitHub repositories have a lot of information, but it's too low level and more than you need. Ping me on the Elixir Slack \(\#nerves channel or DM\) and I'll help when I can!**

A NervesKey is a cryptographic hardware module that has been configured to work with NervesHub. Its primary responsibility is to secure the private keys used to authenticate devices with NervesHub. The following are some options for adding a NervesKey to your device:

1. If you're making a custom board, add a Microchip ATECC508A or ATECC608A to an I2C bus 
2. For Raspberry Pi's, purchase a NervesKey and solder it to the GPIO connector on the Pi
3. Contact us for information about a USB version of the NervesKey
